This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that contains a pseudo-selector, such as `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`.  The problem is that the `@apply` directive doesn't correctly inherit or apply these pseudo-selector styles to the element it's applied to. For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

In this case, the `hover:bg-blue-500` class won't work as expected; the button background won't change on hover.
