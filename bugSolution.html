The solution is to avoid using the `@apply` directive with pseudo-selector classes.  Instead, directly apply the desired classes to the element:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This approach ensures that the pseudo-selector styles are correctly applied by Tailwind CSS.
